# Introduction of Human Visual Perception

## Introduction

- Human Perception of reality dominates the entire field of computer graphics. Until the day the computer graphics is perfect, only approximation to reality can be taken
- with other types of computer programming errors might not be so apparent but in computer graphics they are
- human visual system can be tolerant to bad data in the sense that certain object can be recognizable despite in inaccurate representations
- display can take on many forms such as computer screen, projectors, HUDs, 
- multiple modes of interaction with computer allow for interactive computer graphics

`Directionally Diffuse`: term to describe when beams of light an only go in one direction


## Visual system

- usually seeing a model/object once allows humans to recognize it faster the next time they see it
- certain regions are especialized for detecting motion
- whole visual system contructs model by which we can guide our decisions

`Low Level Vision`: parts of visual system for detecting rapid changes in brightness

`High Level Vision`: parts responsible for forming hypothesis on the nature of reality

`Visual Cortex`: items that make up human's ability to see [optic nerve, eye ball, brain]

`Spatial Frequencies`: number of alterrations between light and dark

## The Eye

-  disparaity of view between right and left eyes help gauge depth of objects
-

`Index of Refraction`: number that by how much light bends in a transparent object

`Depth of Field`: range of view of things that can be seen by eye

### Receptors

-  receptors in eye respond chemically to overall brightness of scene
-  nature of eye brightness perception allow for lack of need to construct displays with overly accurate contrast rations

- `Retina`: area in back of eye where the light arrives
- `Rods`: detect light in low-light situations. More rods than cones
- `Cones`: used for detecting high light
- `Fovea`: area directly opposite of pupil where cone density is highest
- `Optic Disk`: where allmoptic nerves attach to eye
- `Brightness`: used to describe the intensity of the light.
- `Lateral Inhibition`: when amount of overall brightness of perceivable scene affect the amount of receptors that are active

## Constancy and Influences

- human eyes ar e not able to distinquish similar colors unless they are very close together

- `Color Constancy`: ability of perceive and recognize same object despite different lighting and distance conditions

## Shadows

- shadows are important of perception of objects. sometimes objects can be perceived in different ways with different properties but shadows allow for concrete single interpretation
